I've been getting back into 65xx assembly, so I decided to buy a [W65C816SXB SBC](https://wdc65xx.com/Single-Board-Computers/w65c816sxb/) which is a development board designed for education from WDC. The specs for this and the 65C02 version look great, but I really should have tried their [WDCTools](http://wdc65xx.com/Products/WDCTools/) development software before I impulse bought this board! Their software is terrible. I spent an evening last night trying to get it to work but so far have failed. Walking through their [Getting Started](https://wdc65xx.com/gettingstarted/816-sxb-getting-started/) page didn't even work.

Reading through the 6502 forums, I'm not the only person that ran into issues. Most other people that got it working reverse engineered the monitor program and have built their own tools. When they said it had a built in monitor program, I thought I'd just I'd just connect via USB serial and interact with the monitor, but it turns out that it is a binary protocol that only works with their tools.

I'll keep updating this page as I learn more about the board and get it working. I will also serve as a reference to the software that others have created to work with the board.
