Journey Back to the 8-Bit Era: Welcome to My Lab!

Hello, fellow retro enthusiasts! Welcome you to my digital sanctuary, the 8-Bit Labs. This is more than just a blog; it's a personal journey back to the time when 8-bit computers ruled the world. If you, like me, have a passion for retro computers, 6502 and Z80-based home-built systems, Game Boy hardware and programming, and RC2014 computers, you've come to the right place!

From a young age, I've been fascinated by the technological wonders of the 8-bit era. The 6502 and Z80 microprocessors, the powerful hearts that pumped life into legendary systems like the Apple II, Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, and the Nintendo Entertainment System, have always held a special allure for me. Here at 8-Bit Labs, we'll take a deep dive into these chips, exploring their architecture, assembly language programming, and even guiding you to build your own homebrew computer systems based on them.

I missed the Game Boy growing up, but I've gone back and gained a nostalgia for that greenish screen. So, it's only natural that I share this passion with you. Together, we'll unravel the magic that powered those addictive games, delve into the hardware specifics, and even venture into programming our own Game Boy games and writing a Game Boy emulator.

I also have a special place in my heart for RC2014 computers. These modular homebrew computer kits based on the Z80 are simply captivating. As we journey together through the world of 8-Bit Labs, I'll share my insights into building and programming these charming machines.

8-Bit Labs is my way of rediscovering the technology of my youth. When I was a kid, these machines felt like magic. Now, as an adult, the magic hasn't faded; it's just become more intriguing. I've spent years exploring the intricate workings of these machines, and it's been an adventure filled with wonder, discovery, and more than a little learning. It's a journey I want to share with you, as we uncover together the mesmerizing intricacies of the technology that shaped our past and continues to influence our future.

Remember, 8-Bit Labs is not just about me sharing my knowledge; it's about us building a community. I can't wait for you to share your projects, ask questions, and engage with fellow retro computing aficionados. After all, the charm of nostalgia is best when shared.

In the upcoming weeks, look forward to a trove of blog posts, ranging from the basics of 6502 and Z80 assembly programming to tips and tricks for writing Game Boy games. I'll be sharing how-to guides, deep dives into historical hardware, reviews of home-built computer projects, and so much more.

Stay tuned, stay retro!
